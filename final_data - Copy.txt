CHAPTER A - EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS


1.0 WELL CONTROL EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND
REQUIREMENTS

This Chapter of the Well Control Manual (WCM) sets forth the specifications and requirements for Well Control Equipment (WCE) systems for use in Drilling and Workover Operations. Variations or deviations of WCE, specifications, arrangement, pressure rating or requirements from this standard requires endorsement of the Well Control Committee, and approved waiver signed by the Vice President of Drilling and Workover. The enforcement of these equipment standards shall be the responsibility of the Drilling & Workover Operations Managers and Superintendents. The Rig Foreman shall verify WCM compliant equipment is available and correctly installed. If not specified in this standard all WCE shall comply with the respective API Standards and Recommended Practices.

Saudi Aramco Foremen and Consultant Foremen shall maintain only IADC WellSharp certification Level 4 for Surface Installations (No IWCF). Contractor rig personnel shall maintain current well control certification through IADC WellSharp or IWCF. Drillers and Assistant Drillers are allowed IADC Driller Level or IWCF Level 3. Toolpushers, OIM's, Rig Managers and equivalent, shall maintain IADC Supervisor Level or IWCF Level 4.

1.1 General Requirements:
All Drilling and Workover Well Control Equipment shall meet the following requirements:

1.1.1 All WCE (Annular BOPs, Ram Type BOPs, Valves, Chokes, Crosses, Spools, Flexible Lines, Hard Lines, Choke & Kill Manifolds assemblies, etc.) shall be of forged material (no castings), individually Monogrammed to latest edition API 6A, 16A, 16C or other applicable API Standards as defined in 1.1.1, paragraph 1 of this manual. Maintenance, repair and PM Schedules shall be as required in API 16AR and API 53 latest editions and Saudi Aramco WCM.

1) API Monogram and Markings: Saudi Aramco prefers that all WCE in service within Saudi Aramco D&WO Operations carry an API Monogram. Newly purchased/manufactured WCE, after release of WCE 6th Edition as confirmed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Certificate of Conformance (COC), will be required to carry an API Monogram. All WCE markings including; monogram (if applicable), serial number, part number, size, pressure rating, etc. MUST be clearly visible through the painted coating of the equipment. Care should be taken to preserve markings on the equipment nameplate, flange or body to prevent it being obliterated or destroyed during handling, maintenance, repair and use. Additionally, documentation and COC must be available at the rig site reflecting the full equipment details; monogram (if applicable), serial number, part number, size, pressure rating, etc.


2) Periodic Maintenance (PM) Program: Drilling contractors must implement and record a comprehensive schedule-based WCE Periodic Maintenance (PM) Program that meets all requirements of API-53 Latest Edition. The PM Program will be an audit item for adherence and implementation. PM must include a complete list of WCE subject to the PM Program. The list will include the OEM Name, Serial Number Part Number, Size, and Pressure Rating, date of previous PM and schedule date of the next PM. The PM program shall address inspection (internal/external visual, dimensional, NDE, etc.) schedules for WCE critical components and sealing areas; bonnet gaskets, rams, shear ram blades, ram cavities and wetted elastomers (Elastomeric wellbore sealing components are any seal that comes in contact with wellbore fluids, (e.g. annular packers, ram block seals, operator rod or stem seals, valve seat, etc.). Inspections of the choke, kill lines, valves and other well control assemblies shall be performed in accordance with the OEM recommendations and PM program for wear, erosion, plugging, or other damages.

Drilling & Workover
CHAPTER A- EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

inspection intervals for all WCE, including; BOP bonnets, cavities and rams, is not to
exceed each rig move or 90 days whichever is less.. Certain well operations or conditions
(e.g. milling, well control events, bromide use, etc.) will require more frequent inspection
and maintenance. NOTE: Condition-based PM is not acceptable.
1.1.2 TRACEABILITY: All major WCE components including, but not limited to, Ram BOPs, Annular
BOPs, Drilling Spools, Ram Blocks, Valves, Choke and Kill Lines, Choke Manifolds, Gas Busters
etc. will have a unique serial or asset identification number assigned at time of manufacture by
the OEM. The number must be permanently marked in the metal of the component body
and should be paint stenciled in a prominent and visible location on the equipment. This
number must be referenced on all accompanying certification and recertification
documents. Repair numbers are not acceptable for this requirement.
1.1.3 Only OEM parts are acceptable when repairing or redressing the BOP's, ram blocks,
manual/hydraulic gate valves, check valves, manual/hydraulic chokes, safety valves and closing
units. Documentation (e.g.; PO, invoice, certificate of compliance etc.) must be maintained at the
rig site, for all parts verifying the parts are original OEM.
1.1.4 Additional Maintenance and testing requirements may be found in Chapter C "Maintenance
Testing and Certification Requirements" of this manual.
1.1.5 A drilling spool is preferred for primary choke and kill line installation. However in special cases,
such as space limitation, preventer side outlets may be used in lieu of a drilling spool. The
diameter of all preventer side outlets must be at least as large as the choke manifold lines.
NOTE: Side outlets are used for installation of the lower choke and kill lines on 10K/15K BOPs.
1.1.6 The through-bore size of the preventer stack, tubing head, and any adapters used in the BOP
hook-up shall be large enough for the maximum size bit, scraper, liner hanger, packer, plug, cup
tester, bowl protector or any other large diameter down-hole tools to be run in the well.
1.1.7 The pressure rating of all pressure control equipment (BOP, Valves, Lines etc.) must be greater
than the MASP (Maximum Anticipated Surface Pressure).
1.1.8 The inboard manual valves on the choke and kill lines are considered master valves and normally
would not, except for pressure testing, be closed unless the outside valve (HCR) has failed.
1.1.9 Check valves must be installed on kill and emergency lines.
1.1.10 The kill line, emergency kill line and choke lines should be flushed and cleaned out frequently to
prevent LCM or mud solids settling or caking. The BOP stack bore shall be flushed and cleaned
by way of a jetting tool after cementing operations and before nipple-down.
1.1.11 The lower (secondary) choke and kill lines shall not be used in place of the upper (primary) choke
and kill lines for circulation. Primary circulation lines will always be the upper lines connected to
the drilling cross or upper BOP outlet if a drilling cross is not present.
1.1.12 Onshore BOP stack assemblies will be nippled-down between wells to visually inspect for internal
corrosion, erosion and to check flange bolts. Offshore BOP stack assemblies will be nippled-down
and visually inspected every three months as a minimum. The inspection procedure and all
findings must be documented and verified by the Saudi Aramco Rig Foreman. Refer to Chapter
C for maintenance procedures and requirements.
1.1.13 All Rigs shall maintain a logbook of BOP schematics detailing the components installed. The
logbooks shall contain the part number, size, description, serial number (if applicable) and
installation date of ram blocks, top seals, ram and annular packers and bonnet or door seals.
This is to be witnessed and co-signed by the Toolpusher and the Saudi Aramco Representative
(see form #1 in Chapter C of this manual).

The figure demonstrates how the coupling creates a seal and operates without spilling when connecting or disconnecting, making it a \"dry-break\" design.  It is implied that this device plays a role in controlling pressure and preventing spills in the drilling and workover operations discussed in the manual.", "fig_path": "page_26_img_1.jpeg"}

Each pump system shall be protected from over-pressurization by a minimum of two (2) devices designed to limit the pump discharge pressure as follows:
➤ One device shall ensure that the pump discharge pressure does not exceed the system RWP.
➤ The second device, normally a relief valve, shall be set to relieve at not more than 10 % above the system RWP. The relief valve(s) and vent piping shall accommodate the maximum pumping capacity at not more than 133 % of system RWP. Verification shall be provided by either design calculation or testing.
➤ Devices used to prevent pump over-pressurization shall be installed directly in the control system supply line to the accumulators and shall not have isolation valves or any other means that could defeat their intended purpose.
➤ Relief devices on main hydraulic surface supplies shall be automatically resetting. Rupture discs and/or non-resetting relief valves can cause the complete loss of pressure control and shall not be used.
➤ Periodic maintenance must include pressure relief valve settings.

NOTE: All air and hydraulic BOP operating units shall be equipped with regulator valves similar to the Koomey type TR-5. These will not fail open causing loss of operating pressure.

Bottle Pre-Charge Requirements:
3.14.3 Accumulator bottles will be pre-charged with nitrogen as per manufacturer’s specifications/recommendations. The minimum required pre-charge pressure for a 3,000 psi (20.7 MPa) working pressure accumulator unit is 1,200 psi (6.9 MPa). The minimum required pre-charge pressure for a 5,000 psi (34.5 MPa) working pressure accumulator unit is 1,500 psi (10.3 MPa). The nitrogen pre-charge pressure shall be checked and adjusted prior to connecting the closing unit to the BOP stack and any other time the accumulator must be completely de-pressured.
3.14.4 The accumulator should be capable of closing each ram within 30 seconds. Closing time should not exceed 30 seconds for annulars smaller than 18-3/4" nominal bore and 45 seconds for annular preventers of 18-3/4" and larger.

Operating Controls:
3.14.5 All operating controls shall be clearly marked with function and ram sizes. Accumulator controls must be in open or closed position, but not in neutral position. During normal drilling operations the HCR valve next to the wellhead will be closed. Unused functions shall be marked "Out of Service", covered or have the handles removed on the main and remote units. Unused functions shall have the open/close lines plugged at the main unit. All HCR/hydraulic gate valves on the choke and kill lines and on the choke & kill manifold shall be operated via the accumulator closing unit and remote panels. HCR/hydraulic gate valves shall not be operated via the rig floor hydraulic choke panel.

CHAPTER A-EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

Accumulator and Controls Locations:
3.14.6 Master Controls shall be at the accumulator. There must be at least two (2) sets of remote controls for operating the accumulator to activate the BOPs and all HCR valves. HCR valves on the choke line kill line and the C&K manifold shall be operated by the main accumulator unit and remote panels. One remote control shall be on the rig floor, accessible by and visible to the driller and the other shall be located near the Company Representative's office.
Onshore: The accumulator shall be located at a remote location, at least 60 feet distance from the wellbore for oil wells and 100 feet for gas wells, shielded from the wellhead and protected from other operations around the rig.
Offshore: The accumulator shall be shielded from the wellhead and the drill floor and protected from other operations around the rig. It should be located as far as practically possible from the wellhead.

Pump System:
3.14.7 GENERAL: The air and hydraulic pumps must maintain control system available working pressure between 2,800 psi and 3,000 psi (3K System) and 4,800 psi to 5,000 psi (5K System). The air and hydraulic pump on-off pressure and run time settings will be as per OEM specifications. Do not bleed off pressure due to ambient temperature rise. Pressure may vary from 3,000 to 3,400 or 5,000 to 5,400 psi in a 24-hour period. The primary electric/hydraulic triplex pump system must be connected to the rig's emergency power system. At least one pump system shall be available and operational, at all times.
ONSHORE: Two pump systems are required. The required configuration is one electric/hydraulic and the second pneumatic (air)/hydraulic. The primary electric/hydraulic triplex pump systems and the secondary pneumatic/hydraulic pump systems must have independent power sources and operational when the accumulator is in use. Electric/hydraulic pump connected to the main buss and emergency generator with the pneumatic/hydraulic pump connected to an air compressor.
OFFSHORE: It is permissible to have two independently powered electric/hydraulic systems. Each pump system shall have an independent power source. These pump systems shall be connected so that the loss of any one power source does not impair the operation of all of the pump systems. At least one pump system shall be available and operational, at all times. One pump may be powered from the emergency buss on an all-electric power rig. On electric drive rigs, separate electric motors and motor controllers fed from separate busses or from busses that can be isolated by means of a buss tie circuit breaker constitute independent power supplies. With the loss of one pump system or one power system, the remaining pump systems shall have the capacity to charge the main accumulator system from precharge pressure to the system RWP within 30 minutes. Each of the two systems shall have the quantity and size of pumps such that, with the accumulators isolated from service, the following steps are completed within two minutes:
➤ The annular BOP closes on the minimum size drill pipe being used
➤ All hydraulically operated valves opened
➤ Provide the pressure recommended by the annular BOP manufacturer to effect a seal on the annulus.

Pressure Regulator Settings:
3.14.8 The pressure switches, regulators and solenoids for the annular and ram BOP controls will be set as per manufacturer's specification/recommendation. All BOP Shear Blind Ram controls shall have a bypass to route maximum system working pressure to the SBR's.

NOTES: For non-emergency BOP operation, use of the lowest possible pressure will extend elastomer life. Upon completion of the daily testing the pressure regulators shall be returned to the normal operation pressure.
DO NOT close annular preventers on open hole for complete shut-off except in an emergency.
DO NOT close pipe rams without pipe in the hole. Pipe rams should only be closed on the proper size pipe in order to avoid damage to the rubber packer or to the ram carriers (DO NOT CLOSE on TOOL JOINTS).

Shear Ram Safety Covers and Alarms:
3.14.9 The Shear Blind Ram controls are to have the following safety and alarm features:
➤ Safety covers (box style) shall be installed over all SBR controls. These covers will be secured with a pin (that must be removed before opening the cover) and will be of a type that must be lifted to operate the control. They should be clear plastic or have observation holes in them so the position lights may be seen. Covers shall be installed on all SBR controls at all remote stations and the accumulator. NOTE: Touch Screen Control Panels incorporating and requiring dual push button for shear ram activation; will not require the plastic cover.
➤ The covers shall be fitted with switches that will activate horns and strobe/rotating beacon lights when the cover is lifted, before the control is operated. Horns will be installed on the rig floor and at the accumulator. The alarms will be tested during each well control drill and BOP test. The alarms should emit a significantly different sound than the H2S or any other alarms on the rig. Touch Screen Control Panels incorporating and requiring dual push button for shear ram activation shall have the strobe/rotating beacon and horns installed. Both should activate when the dual buttons are pressed.

3.15 Stroke Counters:
Stroke counters provide the Driller a method of measuring fluid volumes when displacing special fluids or lost circulation pills. It is also used to determine pumped volumes when executing well control procedures.

3.15.1 Stroke counters are required on all rigs at both the Driller's station and the choke control console.
NOTE: The kill line should not be used in conjunction with the rig pumps and a stroke counter for hole filling purposes. The kill line is an emergency piece of equipment and should not be used for routine hole fill-up during trips.
3.16 Gas Detectors:
These devices, usually found in mud logging units, are useful in detecting abnormal pressure sections as well as shows of hydrocarbons. Rig Supervisors should monitor the trip gas, connection gas, and background gas for any significant change. The presence of gas in the mud can be one of the more useful indicators of abnormal pressure. Gas Detector readings can sometimes be misleading, however, and the important things to look for are the relative trends and magnitudes, rather than the individual number of gas units reported.
3.17 Drill Rate Recorders:
These devices come in both analogue and digital styles. They are useful as correlation tools, particularly if logs are available from other wells in the area. The records can be used to detect and correlate formation tops and types, as well as in selecting bits and estimating their useful lives. A sudden increase in penetration rate can be one of the first signs of a well kick.

3.16.1 All rigs should have a drill rate recorder.

CHAPTER B-WCE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
VOLUME I


1.0 WCE EQUIPMENT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
This Chapter of the Well Control Manual sets forth the configurations for BOP equipment systems for use in Drilling and Workover Operations. All equipment must comply with the other chapters in this manual. Variations or deviations of BOP equipment, specifications, arrangement, pressure rating or requirements from this standard requires endorsement of the Well Control Committee, and approval by the Executive Director/ Vice President of Drilling and Workover. The enforcement of these equipment standards shall be the responsibility of Drilling or Workover Operations Managers and Superintendents. The Rig Foreman shall verify WCM compliant equipment is available and correctly installed. If not specified in this standard all WCE shall comply with the respective API Standards and Recommended Practices. The BOP equipment must be arranged to allow:
➤ A means of closing the top of the open hole, as well as around drill pipe or collars, and stripping the drill string to bottom.
➤ A means of pumping into a hole and circulating out a well kick.
➤ A controlled release of the influx.
➤ Redundancy in equipment in the event that any one function fails.
➤ All preventers shall be installed so that rams can be changed without moving the stack.
➤ The drilling program shall specify the Class BOP stack (not individual components) to be used.


1.1 Pressure Rating of WCE Systems:
The pressure rating of the WCE system is based on the MASP (Maximum Anticipated Surface Pressure). The minimum rated working pressure of the BOP system shall be selected based on MASP for each hole section as detailed in the table below:

<TABLE>
TABLE B-1
The table below shows the Maximum Anticipated Surface Pressure (MASP) for Oil Wells, Gas Wells, and Injection Wells, corresponding to different WCE Equipment Pressure Ratings.
[["WCE Equipment Pressure Rating", "OIL WELL MASP (in PSI)", "GAS WELL MASP (in PSI)", "INJECTION WELL MASP (in PSI)"], ["3,000 PSI", "≤ 2,550", "≤ 2,700", "< 3000"], ["5,000 PSI", "≤ 4,250", "≤ 4,500", "< 5,000"], ["10,000 PSI", "≤ 8,500", "≤ 9,000", "< 10,000"], ["15,000 PSI", "≤ 12,750", "≤ 13,500", "< 15,000"]]
NOTE-1: Does not include diverter requirements.
NOTE-2: BOP's with higher rated working pressure than shown above may be used at any time.

7.0 CLASS 'C' 3,000 PSI BOP STACK
A Class 'C' 3,000 psi BOP stack (Figure B-7) shall be installed on all power water injector wells during the drilling and acidizing operations in the Arab-D hole section. The minimum equipment required will be an annular type preventer and a hydraulically operated dual ram preventer (or two single ram preventers) with blind rams located on top and pipe rams on bottom. Two (2) 3-1/16" 3M side outlets below the pipe rams are required, one for the kill line hook-up and other for the choke line. The kill line shall be adapted to 2-1/16" 3M and connected directly to the mud pumps or to the stand pipe manifold. A 10" 3M Ball Valve (with 9" bore) is located below the ram preventers and becomes part of the injection tree upon completion of the well.

8.0 CLASS 'D' DIVERTER STACK
A Class 'D' Diverter stack (Figure B-8) will be installed on the conductor and/or next casing of all onshore exploration wells and development wells in the shallow gas area or areas where offset data indicates possible shallow gas. In addition, this diverter stack will also be required on the conductor of all offshore exploration wells and wells where offset data indicates possible shallow gas.

The diverter lines shall consist of Schedule 40 steel piping. This line shall be securely anchored and terminate in the flare pit, 50' beyond the reserve pit or overboard. Saudi Aramco requires two (2) 6-3/8 minimum ID, full bore valves and 8" lines. All lines must be as straight as possible with any turns using long radius sweep elbows to minimize erosion. Offshore, the lines must allow diversion to port and/or starboard. There shall be a Schedule 120, 2" weld X 2" EUE Nipple welded to the conductor casing with a 2" EUE threaded Ball Valve for cement returns and operational tie-in. Fabrication of the diverter lines, elbows and welding of the nipple to the conductor must be done using a WPS approved by the rig operations engineer.

The emergency pump in connection shall be a 3-1/8" 2M flanged connection, located 90 degrees offset from the diverter lines (as noted in Figure B-8 below). The kill line shall be connected directly to the mud pumps or to the stand pipe manifold.

CHAPTER B - WCE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
VOLUME I

WORKOVER BOP STACKS
Maintaining control of a well during the completion and workover phases may be more complicated than well control in drilling operations. Additional complications may exist as, a) various types of workover fluids ranging from low-density diesel to high-density brine fluids may be used; b) interrelated activities may occur simultaneously, such as workovers on a platform with producing wells.

Saudi Aramco has four (4) classes of BOP arrangements for workover operations. The workover program shall specify the Class BOP stack (not individual components) to be used.


9.0 CLASS 'I' 2,000 PSI WORKOVER STACK

9.1 Usage:
This class of BOP Stack is used on water supply wells and shallow, low-pressure aquifer observation wells, where the operation to be performed on the well and/or space below the rig substructure precludes use of ram-type preventers. NOTE: This class of BOP stack with a working pressure of 2,000 psi is not defined in Table 1.1; any given 21-1/4" Annular is typically rated to 2,000 psi and it may be used on wells with a MASP of up to 1,600 psi.

9.2 Class 'I' 2,000 psi Workover BOP Stack Arrangement:
9.2.1 The minimum equipment required will be a Hydril, Cameron, or NOV Shaffer annular type preventer with a working pressure of 2,000 psi or greater. A 2" kill and/or fill-up line shall be connected to the landing base side outlet as shown in Figure B-10.
9.2.2 When sufficient space below the rig substructure is available, a Power Water Injection Tree (ball valve) shall be used below the annular, as shown in Figure B-9.
9.2.3 The annular preventer will be visually inspected and functionally tested prior to installation and pressure tested after installation using a cup-type tester set at a depth of approximately 60'. Test pressures, to be specified in the workover program, shall be greater than the MASP, but shall not exceed 80% of the rated casing burst.

</FIGURE>
10.0 CLASS 'II' 3000 PSI WORKOVER STACK
10.1 Usage:
This class BOP stack is used on most onshore workovers to be performed on producing, water injection and reservoir observation wells. These wells are normally low-pressure and equipped with up to 3,000 psi WP wellhead equipment.
10.2 Class 'II' 3,000 psi Workover BOP Stack Arrangement:
This BOP stack is identical to the Class 'C' Drilling stack as described in Section 7 above.

11.0 CLASS 'III' 5,000 PSI WORKOVER STACK
11.1 Usage:
This class BOP is used on all offshore workovers with wellhead equipment rated to 3,000 or 5,000 psi and onshore workovers with wellhead equipment rated to up to 5,000 psi.

The Critical Well Service arrangement (greater than 5,000 psi WHP) includes the same equipment as in
the high-pressure arrangement, plus a Coil Tubing Safety Head. The lower master pipe rams on the Dual
Combination BOP should be substituted for combination shear/seal and pipe/slip rams when flowing the
well with coil tubing in the hole (i.e. treating or production logging). A second stripper is also required when
treating or production logging. See Figure B-12.

High-pressure and CWS stacks shall comply with the following minimum requirements:
- All equipment comply with or exceed NACE STANDARD MR-01-75 and API Standards for well control
- Rated WP greater than the maximum anticipated well pressure
- Side-door stripper
- Second side-door or radial stripper is required if flowing well w/CT in hole
- Minimum BOP configuration of blind, shear, slip, pipe rams, and master pipe rams below flow cross
- Master pipe rams should be substituted for combination shear/seal and pipe/slip rams when flowing the well with CT in the hole
- Kill line with minimum 2-1/16" flanged connection
- Flow cross with flanged outlets and double valves
- Ability to monitor wellhead pressure below the pipe rams with isolator
- Slip design that will minimize fatigue/deformation damage
- Slip rams capable of holding the pipe up to the yield point with maximum rated WP in a hang-off mode
- Accumulator shall be sized to operate all BOPE (close-open-close) at maximum rated WP

14.2 BOP Equipment Requirements for Snubbing Operations:
The stack arrangements in Figure B-13 and B-14 show basic set-ups for low-pressure and high-pressure snubbing operations. Selecting the BOP arrangement shall be based on the maximum anticipated operating or shut-in pressure.

14.2.1 Low-Pressure Snubbing BOP Equipment Requirements
The low-pressure (less than 5000 psi WHP) or standard arrangement's basic features are the #1 and #2 stripping rams, equalizing loop, safety, and blind rams. The primary rams are the #1 and #2 stripping rams. These rams are used in conjunction with the equalizing loop to strip the pipe into or out of the hole. The equalizing loop and vent line are used to bleed off the pressure. Note that the equalizing loop contains a fixed or positive choke to minimize the surge pressure when bleeding off the pressure. Each set of valves contains one manual and one remotely operated valve. Below the #2 rams is a set of safety or secondary rams to be used whenever either of the stripper rams begin to leak or fail. Below the safety rams is a set of blind rams to be used to shut the well in when pipe is out of the hole or landed in the hangar.

</FIGURE>

15.9 Gas Buster Lines:
There should be a bypass line up-stream of the gas buster directly to the flare line and a valve on the gas buster inlet line to protect the separator from high pressure. The mud discharge line from the gas buster must have a vacuum breaker stacked vent line if the discharge line outlet is lower than the bottom of the separator. This is to prevent siphoning gas from the separator to the mud pits. The vacuum breaker stack must be as high as the gas buster.

One (1) 8" flanged/clamped steel vent line from the gas buster to at least 100' beyond the far edge of the reserve pit shall be required for onshore oil wells.

Two (2) 8" flanged/clamped steel vent line, from the gas buster to at least 100' beyond the far edge of the reserve pit shall be required for onshore gas wells.

The flare pit shall be positioned away from the reserve/waste pits to prevent ignition of any waste hydrocarbons while circulating gas from the wellbore.

VOLUME I
CHAPTER C-MAINTENANCE, TESTING AND CERTIFICATION
REQUIREMENTS

1.0 MAINTENANCE, TESTING AND CERTIFICATION OF BLOWOUT
PREVENTION EQUIPMENT

This Chapter of the Well Control Manual sets forth the maintenance, testing and certification
requirements required for Saudi Aramco BOP equipment. These policies (as well as the equipment
standards and procedures throughout this well control manual) are considered mandatory. Variations or
deviations from these requirements require endorsement of the Well Control Committee, and approval
by the Vice President of Drilling and Workover. The enforcement of these requirements shall be the
responsibility of the Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman (or Liaison-man) as directed by the Drilling Manager
and Drilling Superintendent.

2.0 GENERAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Blowout prevention equipment is emergency equipment and must be maintained in fit for purpose
working condition at all times. The Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman is best positioned to ensure Saudi
Aramco is provided with equipment that meets Saudi Aramco operational requirements and equipment
specifications by being an active participant in the maintenance requirements of the well control
equipment.

Several maintenance items should be verified on a daily basis by the Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman.
The following represent items the Foreman is responsible for reviewing via the Driller's pre-tour checklist
or by personal observation:
2.1 Examine the fluid level in the accumulator. Make sure it is at the proper level and proper
pressures are indicated on the accumulator, manifold, and annular pressure gauges.
2.2 Verify the BOP control lines are arranged to prevent damage by trucks or dropped tools.
2.3 Confirm the preventer controls are either in their proper opened or closed position (not
neutral) and there are no visible leaks.
2.4 Assure the preventer stack is well guyed so that vibrations are minimized while drilling.
2.5 All preventers must be operated at least each time a trip is made (with the exception of the
SBR's). Alternate trip closures between the remote stations and the accumulator. The
annular preventer does not have to be operated to complete shut-off. Do not close the pipe
rams on open hole. SBR's are not to be used as a hole cover.
2.6 The emergency kill line and choke/kill lines shall be washed out as required to prevent mud
solids settling and/or immediately following any LCM operations. Clear water should be
used to flush and fill the lines (except in extremely cold weather, where diesel or glycol
should be used).
2.7 DO NOT circulate green cement through the preventer stack or choke manifold. Always
thoroughly flush with water any item of blowout prevention or well control equipment, which
has come in contact with green cement and verify the equipment is clear of any debris prior
to the next nipple-up.
NOTE: This requirement includes the wellhead annulus valves. If green cement is pumped
through these they must be flushed well with fresh water to ensure that they will
be operable.
2.8 Ensure the rig is centred over the well to reduce drill string and BOP equipment contact and
abrasion.
2.9 Do not use the kill line as a fill-up line during trips.

CHAPTER C-MAINTENANCE, TESTING AND CERTIFICATION
REQUIREMENTS


2.10 If possible, install the ram preventers so that the ram doors are positioned above and shield the valves installed on the casing head below.
2.11 All rigs shall maintain a logbook of BOP schematics detailing the components installed in each ram cavity. The logbooks shall contain the part number, description and installation date of ram blocks, top seals, ram or annular packers and bonnet/door seals. To be witnessed and co-signed by the Contract Toolpusher and Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman (or Liaison-man).
2.12 Only non-expired OEM parts are acceptable when repairing or redressing the BOPE. Furthermore, only OEM approved high-temperature lubricant is acceptable for valve maintenance.
2.13 At least one spare set of ram seals (top seals and ram packers) for each ram size of casing, tubing or drill pipe, as well as ram BOP bonnet seals, must be on the rig site. All elastomer seals shall be sealed in the OEM packaging, stored in climate controlled environment, protected from UV. There is no requirement for annular BOP packer to be stored at the rig.
2.14 Ram blocks should not be dressed until ready to use.
2.15 All BOP elastomer goods shall be kept in a cool place and remain in the original packaging with manufacturer stated expiration dates.
2.16 Preventer assemblies shall be dismantled (nippled-down) and open bonnets between wells to inspect for internal corrosion, erosion or debris and to check flange bolts.
2.17 Manufacturer's installation, operation, and maintenance (IOM) manuals should be available on the rig for all well control equipment installed on the rig.
2.18 New ring gaskets shall be installed on every nipple-up and at every connection nippled down, which has been parted. Ring gaskets shall never be reused.
2.19 Closure bolting studs and nuts for all end and side outlet connections shall be the correct size for the flange or connection. Alloy steel and carbon steel bolting shall meet all the requirements of API 6A and 16A for Land and Offshore Surface service Pressure Controlling/Containing, API 20E BSL-2 minimum and API 6A (for material class and mechanical testing) for NON-EXPOSED BOLTING.

The bolts must be marked as required in API 20E, section 8.2 for BSL-2. Field fabricated studs, saw or flame cut, are not permitted. Bolting that attaches the shear ram blade to the ram block shall conform to:

> The requirements of API 20E BSL-3 or API 20F BSL3 and API 6A as appropriate for the material type.
> Manufacturer’s written specification and requirements for the chemical composition and mechanical properties.
> Shear ram blades, shear ram blocks, and blade retention bolts shall be inspected annually by visual inspection and surface NDE. The inspection results shall be verified against the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria.


Studs and nuts should be checked for proper size and grade. Using the appropriate lubricant, torque should be applied in a crisscross manner to the flange studs. All bolts should then be re-checked for the proper torque as prescribed in API Specification 6A. Bolt sizes 1-7/8” and larger require make-up using hydraulic torque wrenches. Torque values shall be in accordance with API-6A, also detailed in Chapter A, Table A-12 of this manual.

CHAPTER C-MAINTENANCE, TESTING AND CERTIFICATION
REQUIREMENTS

2.20 Field welding shall not be performed on any BOP's or associated well control equipment.
All repairs to BOP equipment must be performed at an OEM facility, or their Licensee repair
facility. OEM repairs and recertification may be completed outside of Saudi Arabia if
necessary.

2.21 A Maintenance Log for each item of WCE equipment shall be maintained. This log shall
include, at a minimum, records of all service and inspections performed on the WCE, serial
numbers for each WCE item and expiration date of all elastomers exposed to wellbore
fluid. The log will travel with the Contractor-owned equipment and shall be kept in the Saudi
Aramco DERU facility for Saudi Aramco-owned equipment.

2.22 API Monogram and Markings: Saudi Aramco prefers that all WCE in service within Saudi
Aramco D&WO Operations carry an API Monogram. Newly purchased/manufactured
WCE, after release of WCE 6th Edition as confirmed by the Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) Certificate of Conformance (COC), will be required to carry an API
Monogram. All WCE markings including; monogram (if applicable), serial number, part
number, size, pressure rating, etc. MUST be clearly visible through the painted coating of
the equipment. Care should be taken to preserve markings on the equipment nameplate,
flange or body to prevent it being obliterated or destroyed during handling, maintenance,
repair and use. Additionally, documentation and COC must be available at the rig site
reflecting the full equipment details; monogram (if applicable), serial number, part number,
size, pressure rating, etc.

2.23 A full OEM certification or recertification of the WCE, must be performed at the start of new
or renewed contract. Thereafter OEM recertification will be as stated below. SEE
CHAPTER C, SECTION 8.


2.24 All WCE ≤3,000 psi: ≤3,000 psi, regardless of gas or oil service will be 5-year
recertification.

2.25 Gas & Offshore Oil WCE ≥5,000 psi: ≥5,000 WCE in Gas or Offshore Oil service will be
3-year recertification and will retain the balance of current 3-year certification if moving to
Onshore Oil service.

EXAMPLE: A 13-5/8", 10K BOP used in Gas or Offshore Oil for 1 year then transferred to
Onshore Oil service will retain the remaining 2 years validity of the COC. OEM
recertification would be required within the following 2 years. If remaining in Onshore Oil
service, the new equipment COC would be valid for 5 years.


2.26 Onshore Oil WCE ≥5,000 psi: ≥5,000 WCE in Onshore Oil service will be 5-year
recertification. However, if ≥5,000 WCE has been in Onshore Oil service for 3 years, it
cannot be transferred to Gas or Offshore Oil and retain the remaining 2-year validity of the
COC.

EXAMPLE: A 13-5/8", 10K BOP used in Onshore Oil service for 2-years then transferred
to Gas or Offshore Oil will not retain the remaining 3 years COC validity. The remaining
validity in this example would be 1 year because of the transfer. OEM recertification would
be required within the following 1 year. If remaining in Gas or Offshore Oil, the new
equipment COC would be valid for 3 years.

The Recertification must be in accordance with the relevant API Specification for
repair/remanufacture. The documentation package shall be kept with the equipment and
must be available for inspection at the rig site by Saudi Aramco personnel.

guidelines.

Test Frequency
3.1.1 BOP equipment (including blind rams and shear blind rams) shall be pressure
tested as follows:
➤ Initial installation
➤ Before drilling out for each string of casing, i.e. 34", 28", 22", 16", 12" 8-3/8" and
5-7/8" for Gas and 22", 17-1/2", 12-1/4", 8-1/2" and 6-1/8" for Oil.
➤ Following the disconnection or repair of any wellbore pressure seal in the
wellhead/BOP stack (limited to the affected components only).

NOTE: When rams are changed, the casing and/or tubing Rams shall be pressure tested
with a test plug and casing/tubing joint to 80% of the pipe collapse or the rated
working pressure of the BOP (whichever is less). The annular preventer shall be

4.0 PRESSURE TESTING PROCEDURE
The recommended pressure testing procedure for a Class 'A' 15,000 and 10,000 psi BOP configuration is given below. This test procedure can be easily amended and made applicable for the other classes of preventer stacks. Although the actual testing sequence may vary somewhat, the ultimate objective must be achieved: To test each individual preventer, valve, and all associated lines in the BOP system from the wellbore direction at a 300 psi low-pressure and then a specified high-pressure.
The pressure source is shown down the drillpipe and through a perforated sub or ported test plug (excluding blind ram or casing test); although, a BOP side outlet may be used. The annular and pipe rams are tested individually in this manner. The blind rams are tested after removing the drillpipe and applying pressure through the kill line, between closed rams and test plug.
NOTE: In the case of the Class 'A' 15,000 and 10,000 psi (non-tapered string, where a lower set of blind rams are positioned below the kill line), the test pressure must be applied through the side outlet of the BOP.
In order to test each individual valve on the kill line, choke line, and manifold; proceed after pressure testing the far outside valves, (all other valves open) by opening these valves and closing each inside adjacent valve, pressure testing, and working inward to the stack.
NOTE: The steps in the following procedure should be performed in numerical sequence. The instructions assume that at the beginning of each step, the equipment is arranged as in the end of the previous step. Therefore, if this particular procedure is not followed in sequence, erroneous test results may be obtained.

4.1 Function Testing and Flow Testing
Before applying test pressure to the preventers, perform the following:
4.1.1 Close and open all preventers. Do not close pipe rams or annular preventer on open hole.
4.1.2 Pump through the kill line, flow line, mud-gas separator, and choke lines and all flare lines with water to make sure none are plugged.

4.2 Fill the Stack with Water
Drain the mud from the BOP stack and fill with clear water.

4.3 Casing Test
A casing test is generally conducted at nipple-up and when testing DV or float equipment. In
addition, this test is required every 14 days (along with the scheduled BOP test), with the use of
a cup tester, to provide a pressure test on casing head valves and verify casing integrity.

To conduct a casing test, perform the following:
1) Connect the pressure source to the kill line and open kill line valves #4 and #5.
2) Open all valves and chokes on choke manifold. Close valve #7 on choke line.
3) Close outer casing head valves #1 and #3a.
4) Close the blind/shear blind rams (or upper pipe rams, if pipe in the hole).
5) Pump into the well through the kill line monitoring/recording the test pressure at the
test pump. For all casing strings other than drive pipe or structural casing, conduct
the test to 80% of the minimum internal yield (burst) of the casing.
6) To test inner casing head valves, close valves #2 and #3 and open outer valves #1
and #3a. (See Figure C.1).

NOTE: Manufacturers recommend against opening rams which are holding pressure.
Damage to the ram rubbers, ram blocks and ram cavities may occur.

4.16 Wellhead Valves
Test all valves on the wellhead individually to their rated working pressure on installation
(using a VR plug) and to 80% of casing burst on subsequent pressure tests, with a cup
tester located correctly in the last casing string.

5.0 ACCUMULATOR TESTS
Control system tests are for the purpose of determining the operating condition of the
accumulator and BOP system. The drawdown test, shall be performed every 14 days in
accordance with API-RP53 (latest edition), at the same time the BOP equipment is pressure
tested, and at any other time deemed necessary by the Saudi Aramco Foreman. The results
shall be noted on the Saudi Aramco BOP Pressure Test Report (see Figure C.13, or Form #2.0
in Section S of this manual). To analyse the performance of the accumulator, the results of each
test should be compared with results of several previous tests. Any increase in closure or
recharge time indicates an immediate need for a thorough examination of the accumulator
system. The accumulator test shall include the following,
: Record the accumulator capacity and useable volume
: Record the accumulator pressure
: Record the pre-charge pressure and last date checked
: Record the closing and opening times for each component

NOTE: Alternate accumulator bi-weekly tests between the main nitrogen unit (with charging
system isolated) and air/electric back-up system (with bottle banks isolated).
Preventer functions should also be operated remotely to insure proper operation of all
functions from the remote stations.

The accumulator test shall also comply Saudi Aramco's general requirements as follows:
• Closing time for ram preventers should not exceed 30 seconds.
• Closing time for annular preventers (less than 18-3/4") should not exceed 30 seconds.
• Closing time for annular preventers (18-3/4" and larger) should not exceed 45 seconds.

The accumulator must have enough stored fluid under pressure to close all preventers,
open the choke hydraulic control gate valve (HCR), and retain 50% of the calculated
closing volume with a minimum of 200 psi above pre-charge pressure, without
assistance of the accumulator pumps.
The accumulator-backup system shall be automatic, supplied by a power source
independent from the power source to the primary accumulator-charging system, and
possess sufficient capability to close all blowout components and hold them closed.

6.0 HANG-OFF LIMITATIONS WHILE TESTING

Many times, a portion of the bottom-hole assembly will be hung-off below the test plug while
conducting a BOP test. This is done for a variety of reasons including:

• Leaves pipe in the hole to circulate through in case the well kicks.
• Shortens the trip time by not having to pull completely out of the hole.

IT MUST BE REMEMBERED however, that hanging-off weight below the test plug reduces the
maximum allowable BOP test pressure. The table below lists the maximum allowable hang-load
for a given BOP test pressure for the wellhead manufacturers used by Saudi Aramco. This chart
should be reviewed before hanging-off and testing BOP equipment.

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

7.0 TEST PRESSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR CASING/TUBING RAMS

Casing rams (and annular preventer) shall be pressure tested with a test plug and casing/tubing joint.
The test pressure shall be 80% of collapse of the pipe of the pipe or the working pressure of the flanges,
whichever is less.

8.0 RE-CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

8.1 A full OEM certification or recertification of the WCE, must be performed at the start of
new contract. Thereafter OEM recertification will be as stated below.

8.1.1 All WCE ≤3,000 psi: ≤3,000 psi, regardless of gas or oil service will be 5-year
recertification.

8.1.2 Gas & Offshore Oil WCE ≥5,000 psi: ≥5,000 WCE in Gas or Offshore Oil service
will be 3-year recertification and will retain the balance of current 3-year certification
if moving to Onshore Oil service.

EXAMPLE: A 13-5/8", 10K BOP used in Gas or Offshore Oil for 1 year then
transferred to Onshore Oil service will retain the remaining 2 years validity of the
COC. OEM recertification would be required within the following 2 years. If
remaining in Onshore Oil service, the new equipment COC would be valid for 5
years.

8.1.3 Onshore Oil WCE ≥5,000 psi: ≥5,000 WCE in Onshore Oil service will be 5-year
recertification. However, if ≥5,000 WCE has been in Onshore Oil service for 3 years,
it cannot be transferred to Gas or Offshore Oil and retain the remaining 2-year
validity of the COC.


EXAMPLE: A 13-5/8", 10K BOP used in Onshore Oil service for 2-years then
transferred to Gas or Offshore Oil will not retain the remaining 3 years COC validity.
The remaining validity in this example would be 1 year because of the transfer.

CHAPTER D-WELL CONTROL POLICIES

1.0 WELL CONTROL POLICIES
This Chapter of the Well Control Manual sets forth the well control policies and specifications that are routinely referenced. These policies (as well as the equipment standards and procedures throughout this well control manual) are considered mandatory. Variations or deviations from these requirements require endorsement of the Well Control Committee, and approval by the Vice President of Drilling and Workover. The enforcement of these requirements shall be the responsibility of the Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman (or Liaisonman) as directed by the Drilling Superintendent.


2.0 WELL CONTROL CERTIFICATION
<TABLE>
All Saudi Aramco Drilling and Workover Superintendents, Rig Foremen, Liaisonmen, Engineers, Engineering Supervisors, Engineering General Supervisors, Liaisonmen Consultants, Contract Toolpushers, Drillers, and Assistant Drillers shall have current Supervisor Level Well Control Certification (Well Cap) from an IADC or IWCF accredited school.
</TABLE>

3.0 USE OF DIVERTERS

3.1 NIPPLING UP DIVERTERS ONSHORE
POLICY
A Class 'D' diverter stack shall be installed on the conductor and/or next casing string for all exploration wells and development wells in the shallow gas area or areas where offset data indicates shallow gas wells. There shall be a Schedule 120, 2" weld X 2" EUE Nipple welded to the conductor casing with a 2" EUE threaded Ball Valve for cement returns and operational tie-in. The nipple must be welded using a WPS approved by the rig operations engineer.
All other onshore areas do not need a diverter.

3.2 NIPPLING UP DIVERTERS OFFSHORE
POLICY
A Class 'D' diverter stack shall be installed on the conductor of all offshore exploration wells and wells where offset data indicates possible shallow gas. There shall be a Schedule 120, 2" weld X 2" EUE Nipple welded to the conductor casing with a 2" EUE threaded Ball Valve for cement returns and operational tie-in. The nipple must be welded using a WPS approved by the rig operations engineer.
The diverter lines must have the capability of discharging to Port and / or Starboard.

4.0 LEAK IN FLANGE OR RING GASKET BETWEEN BOP STACK AND CASING HEAD (WHILE TESTING BOP STACK)
If a leak is observed in a flange during a BOP test, the bolts on the flange should first be tightened to recommended torque. If tightening the bolts does not cure the leak the following should be followed for any leak which would require the removal of the BOP from the Wellhead:
• Set a Cement Plug or RTTS Packer in accordance with GI: 1853.001

CHAPTER D-WELL CONTROL POLICIES

5.0 DRILL PIPE FLOAT
POLICY A drill pipe float shall be run at all times (except when planned operations preclude running a float; as testing, treating, or squeezing).
Ported float valves are not allowed as these ports can be easily plugged and sometimes washout.

6.0 TAPERED STRING
POLICY When working with a tapered drill string always be in a position to have at least one stand of either size pipe available to pick up.

7.0 MAINTAINING MINIMUM OVERBALANCE
General Requirements for Overbalance for Drilling & Workover Applications
POLICY A minimum overbalance shall be maintained on all wells as indicated below:
<TABLE>
- 100 PSI overbalance on Water Reservoirs
- 200 PSI overbalance on PWI and Oil Wells
- 300 PSI overbalance on Gas Wells
NOTE: Water flows, as in Arab-C, may be drilled with flow if hydrocarbons, H2S, or high rates are not encountered.
This table describes the minimum overbalance requirements for various well types.
</TABLE>

8.0 SPACE OUT
8.1 SPACE OUT DATA
POLICY Space out data shall be clearly visible in the dog house and recorded in the IADC tour book each time the rig performs a bop drill.

8.2 SPACE OUT FOR BOP's WITH SBR's
POLICY When spacing out in BOP Stacks with SBR's a tool joint shall be positioned 2-3 feet above the lower (Master) pipe rams. In the event that pipe is to be sheared, the following steps will be taken:
1) Close lower master rams
2) Lower the tool joint lowered to land out in rams
3) Slack off so that the pipe is relaxed (not in tension)
4) Activate the SBR's using proper procedures
NOTE: This procedure will negate the recoil effects of shearing free, suspended pipe allowing pipe to drop and prevent stored energy in drill string releasing suddenly causing a recoil and possible damage to top drive main shafts and lodging pipe across BOP stack.

9.0 SLOW PUMP RATE DATA
POLICY Slow pump rate shall be recorded in the IADC tour book
1) Tourly
2) After a mud weight change
3) After a bit nozzle or BHA change
4) After each 500' of depth

NOTE: May consider stripping over the electric line on a non-radioactive tool if:
A) Hole conditions are poor
B) Large hole size compared to tool OD
C) Open hole section is not known to contain hydrocarbons
Logging companies have a 'circulating sub' that can be made up on the drill string (in the event of a well control situation) to hang off the electric line and enable circulation; however, this may be difficult to install with a strong flow up the drill pipe.

27.0 RUNNING PDHMS AND/OR SMART-WELL LINES ON TUBING OR CASING
Pipe rams will not close and seal around lines and flat packs. The only way wells with these lines installed on the OD of the tubing can be controlled is to close the annular (does not provide a full seal), cut the line and then strip the pipe into the well until the pipe rams can be closed above the line or to shear the tubing and the line. 26.1 and 26.2 (below) outlines the requirements.
27.1 OIL WELLS
POLICY The following SHALL BE required
<TABLE>
1) The use of Shear Blind Rams on ALL smart well and PDHMS completions is required when deep set control lines or flat packs are utilized.

28.0 SETTING BRIDGE PLUGS
Bridge plugs are often set to serve as downhole barriers. Bridge plugs, after being tested (positive and
negative tests), may be considered a mechanical barrier. They are normally run and set in kill weight mud
positively tested then the hole above them is circulated to lighter fluid for the negative test. If the well is
not circulated back to kill weight fluid and the plug fails while tripping out, a pipe light condition could occur
which, if encountered, may not be controllable.
POLICY: The following SHALL BE required
1) Bridge plugs will be run in kill weight fluid
2) Perform positive test
3) Perform negative test
4) Well circulated back to kill weight fluid before tripping out of hole.

CHAPTER-E WELL CONTROL DRILLS

INTRODUCTION
Shutting-in the well quickly to minimize the size of the influx is a major element of successful well
control. Drilling crews can only get proficient in this action through training and practice. The Drilling
Foreman should ensure that the Contract Tool-pusher administers training in the areas of kick
detection and shut-in procedures until proficiency is demonstrated. The training must be repetitive
and frequent enough so that shutting-in the well becomes automatic whenever a kick is detected.

The Drilling Foreman can judge the level of crew shut-in proficiency through the use of pit drills and
trip drills. These drills should always be coordinated with the Contract Tool-pusher. Proper drills and
training can prevent panic and provide for orderly operation if a kick should occur. The following
discussions describe how to conduct the drills and provide a basis for crew evaluation.

1.0 PIT DRILLS
The pit drill is designed to simulate an actual kick while drilling ahead and is designed as
both a teaching and a testing tool. While drilling ahead, it teaches the drilling crews to be
alert for positive indicators of a kick and provides practice in the proper Saudi Aramco shut-
in procedures. It also defines and reinforces the assigned duties of every member of the
drilling crew in well control situations. Pit drills are conducted unannounced so that realism
is created and so the crews can be observed under actual operating conditions.

Pit drills train the Driller to be constantly aware of the fluid level in the mud pits and the return
mud flow, much as the driver of an automobile subconsciously checks his speedometer. This
training is expected to prepare the driller to detect a kick at the first surface indication and
with a minimum of reservoir fluid influx. He will then be able to take correct preventive action,
lessening chances of disaster. Pit drills should be supervised by the Contract Tool-pusher
and coordinated through the Drilling Foreman.

1.1 Equipment
All equipment required for pit drills is to be installed prior to drilling and kept in good
operating condition. A multi-float pit level indicator and flow show device must be available.
A pre-arranged horn or siren signal is an essential part of the pit drill. At the signal, each
crewmember must go immediately to his assigned post and execute his assigned duties.
The Drilling Foreman should note the times required (in minutes) for various aspects of the
pit drills and record them on the tour report. The number and times for these drills should
be relayed to the office.


1.2 Frequency
One or more pit drills should be conducted each day until the crews become proficient;
then at least twice weekly per crew, or more often if deemed advisable by the Drilling
Foreman. Pit drills should be held at least one each day on offshore wells, wildcats, and
wells where above-normal bottom hole pressure could exist. New drillers should be given
special drills and thorough explanation of this practice. It is one of the most important
safety measures that can be initiated and followed.

CHAPTER-E WELL CONTROL DRILLS


1.3 Procedure
Drills are to be conducted during both routine and special operations. Typical times would
be while drilling, shut down for equipment repairs, logging, waiting on orders, circulating,
the Driller has gone to eat and is replaced by one of his men, the Driller is talking to
someone, or any other time there is open hole and blowout preventers installed.

1) The Tool-pusher simulates the kick by raising a float in the mud pits or by raising the
arm on the flow show indicator and making a note of the time. The Drilling Foreman
should assist in observing the crew and recording completion times.

2) The Driller must detect the kick and sound the alarm. The time of the alarm should be
noted. Upon hearing the alarm, all members of the drilling crew should immediately
execute their assigned duties.

3) The Driller should prepare to shut in the well using the approved Saudi Aramco Shut-
in Procedure While Drilling. The Drilling Foreman should be on the rig floor to announce
to the driller that the exercise is only a drill and to stop him before he actually closes
the blowout preventers. The time should be noted when the driller is prepared to shut
in the well.

4) Members of the drilling crew should report back to the rig floor having completed their
assigned duties. These duties may include:

Driller
➤ Shut in the well (simulated)
➤ Record drill-pipe pressure and casing pressure
➤ Record time
➤ Measure pit gain
➤ Check choke manifold for valve positioning and leaks


Derrick-man
➤ Weigh sample of mud from suction pit
➤ Check volumes of barite, gel, and water on location

Floor Hand #1
➤ Check accumulator pressures and pumps
➤ Check BOP stack for leaks and proper valve positions
➤ Turn on water jets to diesel exhausts

Floor Hand #2
➤ Assist Driller on rig floor

CHAPTER-E WELL CONTROL DRILLS

2.0 TRIP DRILLS
The trip drill is designed to train the drilling crews to recognize and respond to kick indications, which occur while tripping pipe. Like the pit drill, the trip drill is useful for both teaching and testing purposes. The pit drill also proves that essential detection equipment is installed and in good operating condition.
The trip drill is supervised by the Contract Tool-pusher with the knowledge of the Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman. All parts of the well control system must be kept hooked up and in good condition, ready for drills.

2.1 Frequency
When a new rig is picked-up, trip drills should be conducted during each trip (both while pulling out and going into the hole) while the bit is up in the casing. When the crew becomes proficient, trip drills should be conducted at least twice weekly per crew, conditions allowing.

2.2 Procedure
1) The Tool-pusher simulates the kick by raising a float in the mud pits and making a note of the time. The Drilling Foreman should assist in observing the crew and recording completion times.
2) The Driller must detect the kick and sound the alarm. The time of the alarm should be noted. Upon hearing the alarm, all members of the drilling crew should immediately execute their assigned duties.
3) The Driller should prepare to shut in the well using the approved Saudi Aramco Shut-in Procedure While Tripping. This will include spacing out and stabbing/closing the full open safety valve. After the safety valve is installed and the Driller is ready to close the preventers, the Drilling Foreman should announce to the Driller that the exercise is only a drill and that it is not necessary to close the preventers. The time should be noted when the driller is prepared to shut-in the well.
4) Members of the drilling crew should proceed with their assigned duties and report back to the rig floor upon completion. These duties may include:

Driller
> Shut in the well (simulated)
> Record drill-pipe and casing pressure
> Record time
> Measure pit gain
> Check choke manifold for valve positioning and leaks

Derrick-man
> Weigh sample of mud from suction pit
> Check volumes of barite, gel, and water

3.0 ACCUMULATOR DRILL
Accumulator drills are designed to verify that the accumulator/closing system is in good working order and that it is properly sized for the particular blowout preventer stack. Accumulator performance must be proven with an accumulator drill when the blowout preventers are first installed (which verifies proper sizing). After initial installation, the accumulator unit performance will be proven and verified in conjunction with the BOP pressure tests schedule (which checks for hydraulic leaks).

Results of the accumulator drill, including closing times of the rams and annular preventer, and initial final accumulator pressures are to be reported on the Blowout Preventer Test and Equipment Checklist. A notation should also be made on the tour report that an accumulator drill was conducted.

Accumulator drills must be conducted when the drill pipe is not in open hole, but up in the casing. At least one joint of drill-pipe must be in the hole for the pipe rams to close on. The Saudi Aramco Drilling Foreman and Contract Tool-pusher should witness all accumulator drills, but the Tool-pusher is responsible for the actual supervision of the drill. Use the remote station to close the preventers every other drill.

3.1 Procedure
1) Turn off all accumulator-pressurizing pumps.
2) Record the initial accumulator, manifold, and annular pressures.
3) Close all of the preventers (except the blind rams). Substitute a re-opening of a pipe ram to simulate the blind ram closure when applicable. Open the HCR valve.
4) Measure and record the closing times for each preventer with a stopwatch.
5) Record the final accumulator, manifold, and annular pressures.
6) To pass the accumulator test, all BOP's must have closed in less than 30 seconds with at least:

1500 psi accumulator pressure remaining (for a 3000 psi accumulator)
Note: Equipment that does not meet these requirements either has insufficient capacity, insufficient pre-charge or needs repair. Closing time for annular preventers 20" and larger should not exceed 45 seconds.
7) Observe the remaining pressure for at least 5 minutes to detect any possible am piston seal leaks.
8) Turn the accumulator pump(s) back on. Record the time required to charge system back up (re-charge time).
9) Open BOP's.
